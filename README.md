# geometric_parameterization_ML

### A test case for geometrical parameterization using machine learning.
You can follow the steps to run the case:

1. generate_mesh.ipynb
2. simulation_data/data_generation
3. data_preprocessing.ipynb
4. The three **AE** code are still under programming.

The simulations are carried out by OpenFOAM v2306.
It is recommended to use conda to manage the Python packages used in the case.
The required packages are listed in the file ___package-list.txt___. You can install it by running: 
> conda create --name <env> --file <this file>
